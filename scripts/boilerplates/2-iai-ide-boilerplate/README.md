# boilerplate for iai-ide boilerplates #

Boilerplates are resources that create other resources.
This boilerplate creates other boilerplate resources.

Each boilerplate has at least the following files:
  - `README.md`: describes the boilerplate and what it does
  - `bash-create`: bash script sequence to create a resource with the boilerplate

This boilerplate will create a new resource (a directory) on the current workspace
which contents will be an example README file and an example bash-script file.
